        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
            including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
            content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
            pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
            css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
            the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
